 # Day 1: Python Programming Basics
# Topic: Introduction, Variables, and Data Types

# Python is simple and easy to learn
# Free and open source
# High-level language
# Portable (Windows, Mac, Linux)


# OUR FIRST PROGRAM is 

print("Namaste")

# print() is a built-in function in Python
# It is used to display output on the screen

print("Hello Viewver here is your first program")

# In the python we can use Charcter set in python
# letter A to Z, a to z
# Digit - 0 - 9
# Special Symbol -+*/ etc
# Also other charactere liike Blank space,tab, newline, ASCII and Unicode character as part of data. 

print("Print in", "same line")

# print Number in python

print("I Print number", 45)

# Arithmetic operations
print("Addition =", 4 + 5)
print("Subtraction =", 10 - 5)
print("Division =", 5 / 6)
print("Modulus =", 5 % 6)

# VARIABLE
#A variable is a name that given to a memory location in a program.

#variable = value
# for example 

name = "sundram" #String

#Here name is variable whose value is sundram like that

age = 50 #Integer

# Here age is variable and 50 is value, variable basically a memory location
# Now we going to print the variable 

print("my name is : ", name," and my age is",age )

#print type of the variable name

print("Type of name variable is ", type(name)) 

# Lets write Data type like boolen and none

old = True
a = None

print("Types of old ",type(old))
print("Types of a is ", type(a))


# Python program sum of two number
#Basic code in python
number1 = 3
number2 = 5

sum= number1+number2

print("Sum of two number is ",sum)

#python is a implicit language.
